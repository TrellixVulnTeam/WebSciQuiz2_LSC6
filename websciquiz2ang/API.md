/countries
This api endpoints returns all the countries in a json along with the SLUG and the countries abbreviation

/total/dayone/country/ + country

This endpoint returns the data regarding the country. This data comes back with the amount of different cases regarding the country the user selects.
I tried to get this endpoint to be connected to the backend but I could not figure out how to get it connected since I need to take the data inputted by the user and move it to the backend
